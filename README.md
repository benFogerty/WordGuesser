# Word Guesser

## My first React project! It is a game similar to wordle but with a twist. Instead of a certain number of guesses, you have unlimited, but there's a catch. You have a timer counting down and every letter you get wrong is -5 seconds on the time while very letter right is +5. The objective of the game is to get as many words right before the timer runs out!
